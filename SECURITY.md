# Reporting Security Issues

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in our code.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/gotofu-com/mochi/security/advisories/new) tab.

The mochi team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

Please note that while we welcome and value these contributions, we do not offer compensation for vulnerability disclosures.

For more information about our security practices, please refer to our [contribution guildelines](https://github.com/gotofu-com/mochi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
